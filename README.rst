The phyglos Catalog
===================

The phyglos Catalog is a BANDIT catalog that contains the necessary "bundles of
functionality" to create and raise a new phy system. It also contains other
bundles to add more functionality to the system in order to raise the X Window
System and the Xfce Destop Environment as well as other common applications like
Emacs, Git, Atom, Firefox, etc. expected in a GNU/Linux distribution.

How to use
==========

This catalog is used with the help of the BANDIT toolkit. The BANDIT can use the
**phyglos-builder** bundle and the **phyglos-core** bundle to raise a new TARGET
*phy system* from a HOST system running phyglos or a supported Linux
distribution. The BANDIT can also use the rest of the bundles in the catalog to
add and manage new software functionality in the system.

See the BANDIT documentation (https://docs.phyglos.org/bandit) to learn how to
use the BANDIT toolkit with the phyglos Catalog to install and remove bundles
and packages in a phy system.

Status
======

The phyglos catalog is in STABLE status. With this catalog the BANDIT can create
a new TARGET system and install phyglos in a free disk partition on the HOST
system.
